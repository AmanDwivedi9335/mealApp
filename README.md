# mealApp
In this repo we will  make Meal App.

In this we have search bar where we can search for any food and if it is available then it will be displayed and we have a heart icon to select and mark as favorite and after that we have upper panel where item description is also shown.

Another key feature of the app is its ability to provide auto-suggestions as users type in the search bar. This feature enhances the user experience and helps users find the recipe they want even faster. Additionally, the app allows users to mark their favorite recipes and save them for future reference. The saved recipes can be easily accessed from the "My Favourite Meals" page, and users can restore them even after reopening the browser.

The Meal App is designed to work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices, making it easy for users to access the app from anywhere. The use of vanilla JavaScript allows for a lightweight and fast-performing application without the need for any additional JavaScript frameworks. This project is a great addition to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in working with APIs, JavaScript, and web development in general.
